An ‘infodemic’ of disinformation between the US and China has been regarded as a dangerous issue in the global fight against coronavirus. The ‘blame game’ tactics and inflammatory statements on both sides heavily politicized the pandemic, in turn negatively affecting the management of the coronavirus outbreak. Some researchers have found evidence that Twitter ‘bots’ are being used in this ‘US–China information Warfare’, particularly for state control and management of public opinion. This is in many ways unsurprising given that political bots have been detected actively trying to shape recent elections in Western Democracies. However, while a growing body of academic work has analysed bots’ functions and their influence on information flows, the influence on people engaging with bot messages has been overlooked. Moreover, although previous studies have expanded our understanding of computationally-driven propaganda in western countries, China’s computational tactics on international platforms, where China cannot impose powerful censorship, have been underexplored. To address these gaps, this PhD will provide a sociotechnical analysis of China’s computational propaganda on Twitter during ‘COVID-19 Blame Game’. By incorporating Social Network Analysis and qualitative methods, this PhD will explore the underlying structure of botnets and public perceptions of bot manipulation, innovatively tracing bots’ influence on public opinion and discourse, from information manufacture to audience distribution and reception. This considerably expanded understanding of political bots will serve to inform platforms and policymakers and provide a range of evidence-based potential actions for combating state-linked computational dis/misinformation during global health crises that could help mitigate future ‘infodemics’.
